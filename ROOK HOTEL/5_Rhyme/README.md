# Problem 5

Write a small React JS web application that prompts the user to enter a word, and in response provides a list of words that rhyme with that word. To find which words rhyme you may use an API, for example https://www.datamuse.com/api/ or any API of your choice.

Note: If you run into CORS issues you can launch chrome without CORS, and assume that we will do the same when we evaluate your submission.
